# PDF Quirk

PDF Quirk is a utility to create PDFs from images easily and fast. The images can either be loaded from storage or directly be scanned.

It is just a little office helper tool to generate PDFs easily to share them online.

PDF Quirk uses the very well functioning tools convert from ImageMagick and scanimage from the SANE project instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Configuration

To scan with PDF Quirk, a optimal scanimage command for the scanner device that should be used must be configured. Since all the scanner devices are so different and offer different scanner options, it does not make too much sense to use a default here.
